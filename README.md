- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChizhovMichael
- 👀 I’m interested in everything related to backend development. I like php, symfony, a bit of devops (docker, kubernetes), working with services like kafka and redis, and of course writing database queries
- 🌱 At the moment I am studying at at ecole 42 (School 21 in Russia) and I have over 4 years experience as a backend developer
- 💞️ I like С/С++ and everything related to viruses... and games. But I have zero experience in game development... as well as in viruses. While I'm studying. But if my experience does not matter to you, then I will be happy to have an internship with you in these areas.
- 📫 You can contact me by email chizhov.michael@gmail.com
